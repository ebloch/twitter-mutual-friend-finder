WHAT DOES IT DO?
This script will show you all the shared connections (shared friends) between two Twitter accounts.


IMPORTANT
> Be sure to change the hardcoded 'source_TwitterAccount' as this is currently set by default to 'ebloch' and will in turn show you mutual friends between whatever account you enter and 'ebloch'.


TO BE COMPLETED
> Better error handling =)


EXTRA!
For some extra love bind this bad boy to a short command in your bash-profile and have Twitter Friend Finder at your finger tips i.e. alias tff='/usr/local/bin/pythonw /Directory/that/contains/twitter-mutual-friend-finder/twitter-mutual-friend-finder.py'
