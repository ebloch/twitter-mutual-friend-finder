WHAT DOES IT DO?
This script will show you all the shared connections (shared friends) between two Twitter accounts

IMPORTANT
> Be sure to change the hardcoded 'source_TwitterAccount' as this is currently set by default to 'ebloch' and will in turn show you mutual friends between whatever account you enter and 'ebloch'

TBC
> Better error handling as there is none =)
