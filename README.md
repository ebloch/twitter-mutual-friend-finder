## What does it do?

This script will show you all the shared connections (shared friends) between two Twitter accounts.

## Important

Be sure to change the hardcoded 'source_TwitterAccount' as this is currently set by default to 'ebloch' and will in turn show you mutual friends between whatever account you enter and 'ebloch'.

## To be completed

Better error handling =)

## EXTRA EXTRA!

For some extra love bind this bad boy to a command in your bash-profile and have Twitter Friend Finder at your finger tips i.e. alias tff='/usr/local/bin/pythonw /Directory/that/contains/twitter-mutual-friend-finder/twitter-mutual-friend-finder.py'
